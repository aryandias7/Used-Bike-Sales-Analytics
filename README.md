# Used Bike Market Analytics (India) 🏍️

## 📊 Project Overview
An end-to-end data analytics project that analyzes resale value trends across 32+ motorcycle brands in India. The goal was to determine how factors like **Seller Type** (Dealer vs. Individual) and **Brand Category** (Budget vs. Premium) impact vehicle depreciation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Python (Pandas):** Built an ETL pipeline to clean raw data, standardize brand names, and categorize 1,000+ listings.
* **Power BI:** Designed an interactive dashboard with DAX measures, dynamic filtering, and custom KPI cards.
* **Data Modeling:** Implemented Star Schema principles for efficient querying.

## 🔍 Key Insights
1.  **Depreciation Gap:** Premium superbikes retain **15% more value** after 5 years compared to budget commuter bikes.
2.  **Seller Premium:** Dealerships list bikes for an average of **20% higher** prices than individual sellers.
3.  **Market Volume:** Royal Enfield and Bajaj dominate the resale volume, accounting for 60% of listings.
