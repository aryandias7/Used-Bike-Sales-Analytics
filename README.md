# Used Bike Market Analytics (India) 🏍️

## 📊 Project Overview
An end-to-end data analytics project that analyzes resale value trends across 32+ motorcycle brands in India. The goal was to determine how factors like **Seller Type** (Dealer vs. Individual) and **Brand Category** (Budget vs. Premium) impact vehicle depreciation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Python (Pandas):** Built an ETL pipeline to clean raw data, standardize brand names, and categorize 1,000+ listings.
* **Power BI:** Designed an interactive dashboard with DAX measures, dynamic filtering, and custom KPI cards.
* **Data Modeling:** Implemented Star Schema principles for efficient querying.

## 🔍 Key Insights
1.  **Rapid Depreciation:** The data reveals a steep depreciation curve, with motorcycles losing approximately **50% of their value** within the first 5 years of ownership.
2.  **Seller Pricing:** Contrary to common belief, Dealerships list bikes for only **~5% higher** prices (Avg: ₹63k) compared to Individual sellers (Avg: ₹60k), suggesting a competitive second-hand market.
3.  **Brand Value:** Premium brands like **Harley Davidson** and **BMW** maintain significantly higher absolute resale figures compared to mass-market brands, despite the age of the vehicle.
4.  **Market Dominance:** **Honda** and **Bajaj** account for the majority of the listed inventory.
